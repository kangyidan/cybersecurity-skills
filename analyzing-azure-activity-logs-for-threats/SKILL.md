# Analyzing Azure Activity Logs for Threats


## When to Use

- When a AZURE security alert triggers and you need structured investigation steps
- When performing a cloud infrastructure review before a compliance audit (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- When investigating unusual API calls, privilege escalation attempts, or resource modifications
- When a new workload is deployed and needs a security posture baseline before going to production
- When building detection rules for cloud-native SIEM (Sentinel, Security Hub, Chronicle)
- When a penetration tester identifies a misconfiguration and you need to scope the blast radius

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Use azure-monitor-query to execute KQL queries against Azure Log Analytics workspaces,
detecting suspicious admin operations and sign-in anomalies.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient
from datetime import timedelta

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = LogsQueryClient(credential)

response = client.query_workspace(
    workspace_id="WORKSPACE_ID",
    query="AzureActivity | where OperationNameValue has 'MICROSOFT.AUTHORIZATION/ROLEASSIGNMENTS/WRITE' | take 10",
    timespan=timedelta(hours=24),
)
```

Key detection queries:
1. Role assignment changes (privilege escalation)
2. Resource group and subscription modifications
3. Key vault secret access from new IPs
4. Network security group rule changes
5. Conditional access policy modifications

## Examples

```python
# Detect new Global Admin role assignments
query = '''
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "Add member to role"
| where TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties[0].newValue has "Global Administrator"
'''
```
