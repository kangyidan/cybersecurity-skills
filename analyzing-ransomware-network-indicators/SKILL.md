# Analyzing Ransomware Network Indicators

## Overview

Before and during ransomware execution, adversaries establish C2 channels, exfiltrate data, and download encryption keys. This skill analyzes Zeek conn.log and NetFlow data to detect beaconing patterns (regular-interval callbacks), connections to known TOR exit nodes, large outbound data transfers, and suspicious DNS activity associated with ransomware families.


## When to Use

- When new threat intelligence describes TTPs not yet covered by existing detections
- When a hypothesis-driven hunt is initiated after a peer organization reports a breach
- When ATT&CK coverage analysis reveals a gap that needs proactive hunting before alerting is built
- When crown-jewel assets (domain controllers, backup servers) need targeted behavioral monitoring
- When MSSP or MDR service requires documented hunt procedures for client reporting
- When a red team exercise concludes and blue team needs to verify detection of TTPs used

## Prerequisites

- Zeek conn.log files or NetFlow CSV/JSON exports
- Python 3.8+ with standard library
- TOR exit node list (fetched from Tor Project or threat intel feeds)
- Optional: Known ransomware C2 IOC list

## Steps

1. **Parse Connection Logs** — Ingest Zeek conn.log (TSV) or NetFlow records into structured format
2. **Detect Beaconing Patterns** — Calculate connection interval statistics (mean, stddev, coefficient of variation) to identify periodic callbacks
3. **Check TOR Exit Node Connections** — Cross-reference destination IPs against current TOR exit node list
4. **Identify Data Exfiltration** — Flag connections with unusually high outbound byte ratios to external IPs
5. **Analyze DNS Patterns** — Detect DGA-like domain queries and high-entropy subdomains
6. **Score and Correlate** — Apply composite risk scoring across all indicator types
7. **Generate Report** — Produce structured report with timeline and MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## Expected Output

- JSON report with beaconing detections and interval statistics
- TOR exit node connection alerts
- Data exfiltration flow analysis
- Composite ransomware risk score with MITRE mapping (T1071, T1573, T1041)
